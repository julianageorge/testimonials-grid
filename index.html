                                    step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only 
                                    say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. 
                                    They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project,
                                    in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
                                    In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly
                                    helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!”
